# Hi there! 👋

This probably useless piece of code was created as a way for me to understand/try out the nodejs filesystem. 

I thought someone could benefit from it too

>Scrapify helps you scrape the content of files in a specified directory and paste it in a 🗁 folder and file of your choice. That's all, its simple and easy. 😃 

## How to use - It's really easy!

Install [scrapify](https://npmjs.org/package/scrapify)

Add it to your package.json like this - 

```json
"scripts": {
    "scrape": "scrapify"
  }

```

Run it on your terminal using npm run scrape \<the-directory-to-scrape-from\> \<the-new-directory\> \<the-new-file-name+extension\>
